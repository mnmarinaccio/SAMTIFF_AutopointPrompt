# SAMTIFF_AutopointPrompt
This repository shows the implementation from SAM-TIFF, where pseudo label masks are created using a hybrid approach of Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided mask generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and Otsuâ€™s thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection.
